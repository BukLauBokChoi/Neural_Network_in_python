This repository will be all about neural networks and there are more to come very soon

### What is a neural network?
An artificial neural network sort of works the same way as biological neurons, but instead of activate or not activate artificial neurons activate by different amounts to express how confident it is. 

Let's go over the most basic thing in a neural network-the perceptron. You can think of the perceptron as a function that takes in some inputs and produces an output
